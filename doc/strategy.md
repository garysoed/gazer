# Strategy

## General

### + Energy or + Card?

## Cards

### Base

`Meditate`: Helps to build decks easily. Maybe too easy, since it allows players to use the same
strategy over and over again. Good for first time play, not good afterwards. Might have to be
replaced in expansions.

`Mind Link`: More stable version of `Energy Orb`. Good combination with Energy Orb to let getting
extra card at the beginning of turn.

`Bot`: All around good card. Staple Minion.

`Energy Orb`: Surprisingly useful. Delaying card play is really good. Hard to defend though.

### Fire

#### Spells

`Fire Ball`: Good against armorless enemy Minions and triggering on damage abilities on your own
Minions.

`Magma Ball`: Good direct damage to Minions, can eliminate a lot of Minions in one shot. Not as
useful as `Fire Ball` due to the high cost and high damage. `late-game`

`Overheat`: Tricky to use for Fire builds due to damage to self. More useful during your turn than
for reacting. Very good for Earth builds. `late-game`

`Recharge`: Good card to have once you have at least 2 devices. Also good for getting energy during
the React phase. `mid-game`

`Construct`: ??? Very situational. Might have to set cost to 1.

#### Enchants

`Pyrophilic`: Good to attach to Minions that stay alive for a while. Use like `Fire Ball`.

`Burn`: Good to attach to Minions that stay alive for a while. Combo well with 1 damage abilities.

`Warm Up`: ???

#### Minions

`Fire Spirit`: Use offensively. Good base Minion for Water build.

`Inferno Spirit`: More durable version of `Fire Spirit`.

`Fire Goblin`: Use defensively or offensively. Good target for single damages.

`Salamander`: When used defensively, can kill attacking Minions before they do any damage. When
used offensively, makes it difficult for the defender to defend.

#### Devices

`Heat Engine`: Tricky to use like `Overheat`, but can be used to do 1 damage to trigger on damaged
abilities.

`Fire Turret`: Good against armorless Minions. Being a Device makes it incredibly dangerous. Also
good for triggering on damaged abilities.

`Crown of Flame`: ??? Good at early game to amass Energy Orbs and Devices. At mid to late game, the
single damage is useful for triggering on damage abilities. `early-game`

`Fire Orb`: Target Minions that are dying and have attacked. Very good when targeting vines
with Earth build.

`Thermo Cycle`: Good card to have once you have at least 2 devices. Very good when targeting vines
with Earth build. `mid-game`

`Magma Tower`: Good at destroying enemy Minions quickly. Need a way to keep up with the self damage
though. Very good when targeting vines with Earth build. `mid-game`

`Solar Orb`: Very good for reacting. Kill a weaker Minion and summon a stronger Minion to react.

### Earth

#### Spells

`Purify`: ??? If your deck is Minion light, this acts as a weak deck search. If your deck is Minion
heavy, this can act as Draw 5.

`Pottery`: Good for getting key Minions and putting them into play. `early-game`

`Evolution`: Good for upgrading Earth Minions into Bots. Can also act as draw 1 and trigger on
entry abilities.

`Call to Rise`: Good way to retrieve key Minions that are just killed. If you have discard abilities
this can be used as a deck search.

#### Enchants

`Group Spirit`: Good way to retrieve cards quickly. At the start of the game, use it to quickly put
key cards into play. Late game, use it to put key dead Minions back into play. Also use it to delay
resting.

`Natural Selection`: Good deck search. If you have a lot of "draw from discard", you can start using
the discard effect to get cards quickly. The reordering is also good for Air spells.

`Symbiosis`: Cast on vulnerable key Minions. Good to use with Vines or any Minions with armor.
`mid-game`.

`Flora Secret`: At early game, this is a good way to quickly build up your Minions (draft lots of
Bots). Later, use this to gain advantage by deck size. Make sure to have ways to do deck search to
minimize deck dilution.

`Hive Mind`: Basically Minion cost -1. Key card for playing Earth build.

#### Minion

`Sun Squirrel`: See `Group Spirit`. Don't use for attacking unless you are sure that no Minions can
block it.

`Pack Leader`: See `Hive Mind`. As Minion, it's an ok defender.

`Bot Leader`: See `Flora Secret`. This is the second best Earth defender Minion. It is immune to
most Fire attacks.

`Jungle Vines`: Important card to trigger the "Minion comes into play" abilities. This one has
flexible use.

`Thorny Vines`: Great attacking card. Use aggressively. Let it attack and get killed, and resummon
it from the discard pile.

`Bark Vines`: Can be used in two ways: 1) summon once and use it for defending aggressively. 2) Use
for transmutation and summon during reaction.

`Earth Spirit`: The best Earth Minion. Minion comes into play ability acts as a weak deck search and
whittles down opponent's deck. Armor protects it from most Fire attacks. Can also attack. Be careful
using this against Earth builds.

#### Device

`Composting Staff`: At early game, this is equivalent to Mind Link, except that you can control
when to use it. When you have discard search abilities, the discarding part can make search easier
while at the same time attacking your opponents.

`Revival Pendant`: See `Group Spirit`. Make sure to use this before reshuffling.

`Rest Hollow`: A key card to trigger entrance abilities. This doubles as a healing spell. Drawback
is that you need some un enchanted Minions.

### Air

#### Spells

`Gathering Storm`: Key card for spell heavy decks. Collect Spells in your hand and use this before
explosively casting all the Spells. You only need to cast one of this at a time since most Spells
have a cost of 1.

`Reset`: Spell heavy air decks cycle through the deck really quickly. When you have draw heavy
cards like Intelligence, use this to make sure that you have cards to draw from your deck.
`late-game`

`Demoralize`: In early game, use this to return dying Minions into hand. You can resummon the same
Minion to fully heal the Minion, or use the gained Energy for Energy boost (useful when reacting).
When combined with Mind Control, this is devastating for Water Minions who are Enchant heavy as it
is capable of discarding all of its Enchantments.

#### Enchant

`Intimidate`: Good way to finish off Devices and Minions since this is unblockable. Also useful for
targeting players.

`Flight`: Cast this on Minions with strong attacks to let it destroy devices. Even though this is an
Air card, this is more useful for Water builds. Air builds can still use this on Bots and Psyche
Mage.

`Intelligence`: Basically a Spell cost - 1. This stacks up better than Gathering Storm, though keep
track of the deck size.

`Gust`: Very effective against Minion light decks, like Water builds. During your play step, you can
ensure hitting your target. During react step, this can be used for stopping Minions from attacking.
This can also be used to tap Devices during react step.

#### Minion

`Mind Devourer`: Use this to deter your opponent from massing cards in their hand by discarding
their clear cards. Very effective in stopping Water builds from being able to summon powerful and
expensive Minions. Also generally useful to keep track of what cards your opponent has.

`Winged Terror`: The Flying ability means that it can pick out and destroy Devices. Focus on
whittling down your opponent's life and don't use this for defending.

`Psyche Mage`: Can rake up a lot of attack power towards the end of game. Give him Flying or a bunch
of defensive Enchants. `late-game`

#### Device

`Mind Controller`: Good against powerful Minions with lots of Enchants. Use during your play phase
to give you more attack power, or use during react phase as an additional "tap" ability. `late-game`

`Dust Devil`: Use in conjunction with cards that lets you discard cards from opponent's hands. When
they have just important cards in hand, you can use this to make sure that they lose their key
cards.

`Redirection Chamber`: Good for both aggressive and defensive play. Defensively, you can redirect
an attack to the opponent's target. Aggressively, this makes the attack unblockable. Defensive play
is more preferable though.

`Looking Glass`: Can be used as a deck search. You can also use this offensively to delay your
opponent from accessing key cards.

### Water

#### Spells

`Healing Stream`: At early game, the untap ability will be more useful. Towards the end, as you have
Minions with a lot of life, the healing is great. Consider using this with Minions with "on damaged"
abilities with a lot of life.

`Flood`: This makes the Minion's attack power skyrockets. Good for surprising your opponent when
reacting. Have a Minion attack, and during your reaction phase, cast this to kill a Minion while
defending. You can also use this to attack players.

#### Enchants

`Ice Armor`: Incredibly useful Enchant. This immediately blocks most attacks.

`Everlasting Water`: Alternative to Ice Armor. When cast, this acts as a one time healing (since
the amount of damage sustained stays the same). Combine this with any healing spells for good combo.

`Piercing Icicle`: Cast this on Minions with high attack, and play offensively. Opponents will be
forced to defend with Minion, or risk losing all of their devices. This is more of an end game card.
`late-game`

`Icy Spear`: This builds up your attack quickly. Defensive Minions are better for this since the
benefit from this Enchant tends to eclipse the Minion's innate attack power. Keeping the Minion
alive is generally better.

`Healing Water`: A slower version of Healing Stream. This good in early game, or for Armored
Minions.

`Shiny Crystal`: Extremely good with cards that scale up with number of Enchants.

`Clarity`: At the beginning of the game, this is good for getting the Energy boost. Towards end of
game, as your deck is filled with Enchants, this allows you to grab and discard the Enchants, which
is better than transmuting cards.

#### Minions

`Ice Golem`: Decent defender and attacker. The 2 armor and ability to soak damage makes him a good
protector.

`Rain Sprite`: Staple build for Enchant heavy decks. It basically doubles the energy value of all
Enchant cards. Also a decent attacker and defender.

`Water Blob`: The healer of the group. Decent defense, not so good offensive. This is a good target
for "when damaged" abilities, especially the ones that do 2 damage.

`Mist Folk`: Practically invincible, due to high armor and high life. Discard ability lets it defend
against many attacks, though it still struggles when outnumbered.

`Wave Maker`: At early game, a weak attacker. But when your deck is filled with Enchants, this can
boost up the damage really high. Good candidate for attacking due to the high Life.

#### Device

`Steam Engine`: See Rain Sprite.

`Water Bearer`: Good replacement for Healing Stream, though not as flexible, since it only targets
Minions with Enchants. Easily fully heals Minion with Everlasting Water since both scales at the
same rate.

`Water Pump`: See Icy Spear.

`Refreshing Jar`: Very flexible. Use for defending or attacking.

# TO decide
-   Defender decides the battle resolution.
-   How long does Energy last?
-   Refresh applies to cards you own.
