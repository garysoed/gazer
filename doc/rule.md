# Rule

## Terminologies

-   Turn: Game consists of turns, which consist of phases.
-   Phase: Where players take action

## Setup

-   Every player starts with 30 life
-   Give every player their starting deck:
    -   2 Bots
    -   2 Energy Orbs
    -   2 Meditates
    -   2 Mind Links

## Turn order

Every turn consists of the following phases:

1.  Beginning of the turn:
    -   Play cards
    -   Activate abilities
1.  Refresh & Cleanup:
    -   Discard any spells in play
    -   Discard any transmuted cards
    -   Untap any Minions and Devices
1.  Plan:
    -   Draw 4 cards from the deck
    -   OR shuffle the discard pile and put it under the deck
1.  Draft:
    -   Draft a card from the draft row
    -   Play cards
    -   Activate abilities
1.  Action:
    -   Activate abilities
    -   Play cards
    -   Transmute cards
    -   Attack

You may take action in each phase in any order you wish.

### Activate abilities

Minions and Devices have abilities. As long as the phase allows, and you meet the requirements, you
may activate them.

### Play cards

You need to spend the energy requirement to play a card.

### Transmute cards

To transmute a card, put it into play with the back side up. You gain 1 `Energy` for transmuting a
card. There are no requirements for transmuting a card.

### Attack

Attacking involves 3 subphases:

1.  Declare: You declare the target to attack, and the Minions to attack with. You can pick the
    Plyaer, or any Devices.
1.  React: **This is the defending player's phase**. During this phase, the defending player may:
    -   Play cards
    -   Activate abilities
    -   Assign Minions to defend each attacking target. One Minion may only defend against one
        target, and no two Minions can defend against the same target. Only untapped Minions can
        defend.
1.  Resolve: For every attacking Minion, if the Minion is untapped, do the following:
    1.  Tap the Minion.
    1.  Damage the defending Minion if any, or the declared attack target.

During the `Action` phase, you may use the Attack action any number of times. However, you cannot
choose the same target to attack more than once.

## End game

Game ends when there is only one alliance with players whose has some life left.

## Additional rules

-   Energy does not persist beyond a phase. E.g.: If you activate `Energy Orb` during your
    `Beginning of the turn` phase, you cannot use it during your `Action` phase.
-   When you draw cards from your deck, and you don't have enough cards in the deck to draw, you do
    not shuffle the discard pile into the deck. The only way to get cards back in your deck is
    during the `Plan` phase, or using special abilities.
-   Cards drafted go to your discard pile, unless specified.
-   When a target is damaged, reduce the damage by the amount of Armor that the target has.
-   Always apply effects on an ability completely before moving to the next ability.
